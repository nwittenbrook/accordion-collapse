==================

Wordpress plugin made for UW Marketing &amp; Communications.

Inserts a button into the wordpress text editor for posts that allows the user to autogenerate a shortcode to wrap their content in, allowing it to be shown and dismissed by clicking a header. Uses some CSS3 animations for sliding and revealing.
